******E-Learning Recommendation System******

An intelligent recommendation system built with Flask and machine learning models to personalize educational content based on learner behavior and performance. It uses classification, clustering, regression, and reinforcement learning techniques to deliver tailored learning experiences.

****🚀 Features****

🎯 Personalized Score Prediction using Linear Regression

🧠 Student Classification via K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📚 Topic Recommendation using Naive Bayes

👥 Learner Grouping via K-Means Clustering

🤖 Learning Path Optimization with Q-Learning

💻 Interactive Web Interface built using Flask & Bootstrap

🔐 Secure User Authentication with Flask-Login & Flask-Bcrypt

****🛠️ Tech Stack****

Backend: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Numpy, NLTK, Joblib
